Made by [Raveena](https://github.com/ravennas1025) and  [Josue](https://github.com//josuem9217)

The purpose of this project was to collab with each other on github's main platform to show our understanding of dealing with merge conflicts, learning how to work with each other at the same time on cloud 9's editor and linking files.
